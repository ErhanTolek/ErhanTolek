- 👋 Hi, I’m Erhan Tölek. I'm a QA & Release and Test Automotion Engineer

- 👀 I’m interested in Test Automotion and Developments.
I'm working on a project that I'm converting all the manual test cases(app. 1000 cases) into a automotion test by Selenium/Pytest in Python currently, 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Gherkin scenarios into the Ruby Cucumber and/or Java Cucumber and automation framework tools 
such as Selenium, Cucumber, Cypress, WebDriverIO. Beside that I'm quite interested Software Development and taking some beginner software language courses.

- 📫 erhantolek2207@gmail.com is my reachable mail address that i currently check!
