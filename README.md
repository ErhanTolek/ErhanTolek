- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Erhan TÃ¶lek. I'm a QA & Release and Test Automotion Engineer

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Test Automotion and Developments.
Working on a project that I'm converting all the manual test cases(app. 1000 cases) to automotion tests by Selenium/Pytest in Python nowadays, 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Gherkin scenarios into the Ruby Cucumber and/or Java Cucumber and automation framework tools 
such as Selenium, Cucumber, Cypress, WebDriverIO. Beside that I'm quite interested Software Development and taking some beginner software language courses.
